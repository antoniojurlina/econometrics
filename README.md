# Econometrics

This is the repository for three projects I completed as an undergraduate, in econometrics. First two were in collaboration with other students, last one was a solo project.

### Empirical Project 1
This empirical project is centered on the comparison of color proportions between two different candies: M&M’s® and Skittles®. Both are manufactured under the Mars, Inc. umbrella of products and each candy brand features a multitude of variations of the original product. For the purposes of this project, smallest available packages (publicly marketed as “Fun Size”) were used, comparing specifically milk chocolate variety of M&M’s® with the “original” variety of Skittles®. Data obtained details the total number of button-shaped candies per bag as well as the specific number of each color of candy present per bag.

### Empirical Project 2
In this project, we used different variables depicting a college student's background (high school GPA, SAT scores...) and their current life (belonging to fraternities or sororities, belonging to study groups, alcohol consumption, ...) as a way of estimating their impact on college GPA. We estimate a simple OLS and present the results.

### Empirical Project 3
The Cardiff City region has a population of over 1.2 million people encompassing 10 counties of the UK. Transport has been a significant concern for over a decade with population growth outpacing infrastructure expenditure. Anecdotal evidence suggests that congestion is a major issue for residents of the city region (impact on the overall quality of life). Suggestions have been put forward to build a new metro system as well as introducing a congestion charge for those driving into the center of Cardiff. Prior to any of these investments/changes, the council authority wants to explore the impact of congestion (and related investments) on resident’s satisfaction (e.g., satisfaction with place of residence and working in Cardiff).
In empirical project #3, I will explore some of these factors, specifically I will explore the impact of congestion on resident’s satisfaction. To help facilitate this analysis, the council conducted a survey in cooperation with the Cardiff Business Partnership (an industrial development body comprising the largest private employers) to understand the concerns of residents. The survey was administered online over a 4-month period and yielded over 2,094 completed returns. The data from this survey, contained in the file labeled ‘CBP survey.dta’, along with a copy of the survey for decoding the contents of this data file, have been provided.
